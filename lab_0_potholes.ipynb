    "#### About pothole data\n",
    "- Part of CDoT's job is to fill potholes in city streets. To do this, they rely on city residents reporting potholes to the 311 system, which keeps track of all the reported pothole locations as well as the status of repairs.\n",
    "- The pothole data lists every report of a pothole to the city between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2018.\n",
    "- Below, we take a peak at the data to get a feel for what it looks like. \n",
    "- Notice that the number of pothole reports the city gets changes over time. This is true for two major reasons:\n",
    "    - Winter weather damages streets. When the streets thaw out each spring, that damage turns into potholes. Therefore, we see more reports in the spring than other times of year.\n",
    "    - Some winters are more mild or harsh than other winters. 2014 was one of the [worst winters on record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_2014_North_American_cold_wave), and we see many more pothole reports that year.\n",
    "- Notice also that we have the average amount of traffic on the streets with reported potholes. \n",
    "    - This comes from a different city data source, which measures the number of cars per day driving on busy streets.\n",
    "    - About half of pothole reports are from streets with no traffic data. These streets are generally small and have low traffic."

    "## Section 3: Algorithm to the Rescue\n",
    "- The city recieves thousands of pothole reports every week! While they do eventually fix all potholes, with so many reports it can be hard for us to know where to start. \n",
    "- This is where algorithms, \"expert systems,\" and machine learning can come in helpful. These tools can give us a prioritized list of where to work first. \n",
    "    - In real life, Chicago already uses one of these to plan their pothole repair schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approaches\n",
    "- As with any problem, there are multiple ways we can try to solve this and get the city a list of which potholes to repair first. \n",
    "    - **Random**: We could just pick random potholes to fix each day.\n",
    "    - **First come, first serve**: We could fix the potholes in the order they get reported to us.\n",
    "    - **Busy streets first**: We could fix potholes on the busiest streets first, so that the repairs we make help the largest number of drivers.\n",
    "    - **Most complaints first**: Multiple people can (and do) call to complain about a single pothole. In order to minimize complaints, we could fix the potholes with the most complaints first. \n",
    "    - **Other**: We could think of other ways as well. The real algorithm the city uses is more complicated than these ones.\n",

    "- In this lab, we examined a **real case of algorithms** being used in society. We put ourselves in the shoes of the Chicago Department of Transportation and built several algorithms to help us repair city infrastructure. \n",
    "- These algorithms were all built with **neutral information** about the problem at hand: reports about potholes and road use.\n",
    "- But, we saw that some of our algorithms had **unintended concequences**. Not all communities got the same level of service when we simulated using these algorithms. This means we should worry about **fairness and equity**: is everyone being treated equally as a result of our algorithms? \n",
    "- After we saw that not every community was treated the same, we looked for **systematic bias** in the algorithms' results. We checked whether some algorithms treated rich and poor neighborhoods differently. \n",
    "- **The point to remember** is not which specific algorithm is best, or which way or measuring fairness is best. Instead, the major lesson from this lab is that algorithms sometimes have unintended concequences when they get used for making real world decisions. We told the algorithms nothing about the neighborhoods where potholes were located, but those neighborhoods still weren't all treated the same way by the algorithms. Thus, any time someone proposes to use an algorithm for making decisions like this, they should first simulate it and measure what effects it would have. Would the results be fair? Would they be fast enough to meet goals? These are important questions anyone can ask about the **outcomes** of algorithms, even if they don't understand how the algorithms work on the inside. \n"
